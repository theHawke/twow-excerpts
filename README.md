# twow-excerpts

A collection of all the sample chapters for George R. R. Martin's "The
Winds Of Winter" released so far (May 2015).

I built this mostly because I wanted to have some central place to
read them myself (the font on the older archived versions is also
hideous and awful to read). Later I decided to use this to try out
[hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to build the website.

Markdown versions of the text are available in `gen/chapters/`.
